```

#### 2. Quick run of app. For development or a quick check, you can use the following command:

```bash
  # run for development
  npm run dev
```
#### The terminal will output a link (e.g., http://localhost:5173). Open this link in your browser to view the application.

#### 3. For build and review the application you need to run two commands:

```bash
